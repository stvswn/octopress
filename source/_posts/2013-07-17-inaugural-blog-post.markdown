So this is the first of what I hope will be recurring blog posts.  I plan to write about things I find interesting, or things I know something about, or both.  

So a little about me -- I'm currently an MBA student at the Wharton School in Philadelphia.  Before graduate school, I was an Army officer.  I mostly served in the 25th Infantry Division out of Hawaii, and in my five years of active service I deployed to Iraq for 12 months.  Even before that, I was a cadet at West Point in New York.  I've been married to my high school sweetheart for five years.

I'm interested in everything tech related, and in the past couple of years I've taught myself a bit of coding and I'm trying hard to get a job in Silicon Valley.  This summer, I'm interning at a social media startup in a product management role.

This is my second blog using Octopress - I also designed and manage <a href = 'http://www.whartonveterans.org'>the home page</a> of the Wharton Veterans' Club.  

Stay tuned!
