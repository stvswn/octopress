I am an MBA student at <a href='http://www.wharton.upenn.edu'>Wharton</a>, an Army veteran, and a tech wannabe.  I've co-founded a startup attempt - <a href='http://www.gramicon.com'>Gramicon.com</a> - and I'm in charge of the Wharton Veterans Club <a href='http://www.whartonveterans.org'>website</a>.  I am a product management intern at <a href='http://www.hangtime.com'>Hangtime</a>.  I'm interested in all things tech, but especially in how to use data for testing and marketing.

I like traveling with my wife, reading, skiing, Crossfit, television, and messing around with computers.  I also like my shih-tzu, Bandit.
